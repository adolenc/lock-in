**DO NOT READ THE SOURCE CODE.** 
This is an app that was entirely vibecoded over the weekend with minimal manual code review to test the functionality of the newest agents.
They failed to create something like this a year ago. They succeeded today.

Android app for tracking the fitness progress. 
It is meant to be for personal use only, replacing my old and trusty notepad for tracking weights and reps.

Features some nice things to make life easier or more fun:
 - simple creation of predefined workouts for 4 days in a week
 - simple entry of the weights used (with colors matching stacks on my powerblock dumbbells), reps done, and drop sets, along with any custom notes
 - automatic rest time between the reps with notifications
 - week progress tracker with little green icons next to finished days
 - statistics screen with a heatmap for gamifying the process or tracking actual progress
 - a Chaewon app icon reminding you to lock in every single time you fire up your phone
